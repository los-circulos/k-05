# k-05 3d print handle for control line airplane models

Based on control line handle design https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4312610

Current version: V3 with adjustable offset

Recommended for up to 1 - 1.4kg / 2 - 3lbs airplanes, depending on material used for printing.
Simple PLA prints were tested up to 25-30kg pulls, including safety hook.

My print settings:
 - layer height: 0.12mm
 - wall count: 4
 - infill: cubic 20%

BOM:
 - 1* handle side piece "A"
 - 1* handle middle piece "B"
 - 1* handle side piece "C"
 - 2* M4*16 allen bolts
 - 1* M4*20 allen bolt
 - 3* M4 nut
 - 1m 3mm non-streching nylon chord
 - thread to make hooks on chord
 - epoxy to fix thread
 - optional: 6-8mm shrink wrap tube to cover threads
 - 2 "quick links" to attach cables

Assembly:
 - cautiosly drill bolt holes to 4mm (they are made for a tight fit)
 - cut chord to two pieces, a 400-450mm for the leads and rest for safety wrist hook
 - burn one end of each chord with a lighter, forming a "needle tip". This will help routing chord through holes
 - route the shorter chord through the holes in B - A - A - B (in this order, see photos). 
Chord should fit in the grove on side piece "A" and in the tunnels of middle piece "B"
 - assemble the 3 pieces with the 3 bolts
 - make hooks on both ends of the leadout cable. I prefer sawing the chord to itself to form a hook. 
 - make one hook on one end of the safety wrist hook
 - fix the threads with epoxy. Optionally cover threads with shrinkwraps
 - form a big hook with the small hook on the safety wrist hook chord
 - route chord through hole in the corner of middle piece "B"
 - make a big knot which prevents chord slipping back out of the hole. Burn knot with a lighter to fix it
